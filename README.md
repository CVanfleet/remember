# Overview

This is a project I have been looking forward to for a while! I have alway's loved Apple products, they provide such great technologies for us! That is why I have been dying to build my own iOS app. 

This app is called Remember (may change the name later). This app allows you to input special events and their dates into the app. The app then displays a countdown so you know exactly how long you have until the date. 

Unlike my wife, I am very forgetful. This app will help me remember those special events like anniversaries, birthdays, holidays, etc..

Here is my demo of my project so far:

# Future Work

* Create an event for when the countdown reaches 0.
* Create a widget so the countdown is visible on homescreen/lockscreen.
* Change the layout to make it more pleasing to the eyes.
